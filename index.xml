      <description>This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, WalkingUpstairs, WalkingDownstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying. This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

      <description>This project is required to predict the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.</description>

      <description>Here ,I have done my first Exploratory Data Analysis on haberman data set:
In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods
Data set explanation: The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago&amp;rsquo;s Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.</description>
